![Dancing](/assets/2019-09-24-hotel-chicago.jpg)

I just turned the lights off in my hotel room before dancing in front of the window. A few minutes prior I did it with the lights on to rebel against you bastards who would make fun of me for it. Because I felt like I could take every one of you mother fuckers.

But then I thought about it, and decided it was actually pretty silly to dance by myself in front of the window. I'm comfortable enough telling people I do it. But I'm not comfortable enough to do it in front of them. So lights off!
