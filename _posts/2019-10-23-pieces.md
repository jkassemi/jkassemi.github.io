![Broken Plate](/assets/2019-10-23-local-clay-piece.jpg)

Sometimes they don’t make it through in one piece.

This was the result of firing the first piece I made with materials from my back yard, which sits next to the #riogrande in the #albuquerque bosque. The clay I gathered was incredibly silty and poorly filtered - the next batch I have is much easier to work with.

This piece broke before it was fired, but I wanted to try it out and see how it would change in the kiln. For the first time I targeted and hit the cone (04) I expected to. I’ll try putting this through higher temps, but I know it melts into a dark black brown at around cone 8 (which I accidentally hit last time around). The grass to the right isn’t identified just yet. It’s #poaceae of some sort, maybe Canada Wildrye.  I found it this evening while harvesting seeds on the ditch trail behind the property with my daughter. We collected over a dozen different types, and raced an ant boat down the stream. I used to do that with boats I’d make down the Platte at confluence park in #denver.

You can see how the plate turned red after firing. It’s a beautiful terra-cotta, and I need to learn more now about the iron that I believe is causing it. If I can tune it and how it’s fired, I can get blacks and reds like the Romans.  The plan is to plant seeds from these native #plants in pots we make out of the earth in the area. Get to know them a little and spend some time talking with them. Then to figure out how they‘d like to raise their families. I’m imagining an entire village in the yard constructed by their vision and preferences.

I have about a pound and a half of the new batch of clay - and I’m really struggling to both figure out what I want to throw with it first, and with my enemy, #perfection. Who’s super cruel to artists new to a craft.

I think the lighting here exaggerates the mountains in the crack. And the waves of sunshine from the piece illuminate the potential for a new life in the few seeds still attached to the grass. Opportunity and beauty embracing the broken edge.
