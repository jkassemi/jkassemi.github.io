I think this yard needs a peahen. A mount of the god of art and war.

Or is it time to move? The neighbors are always trying to sell something cheap. I don’t know if it’s really the place for an American anymore. Maybe Texas? California?
New Mexico?

But it’s a beautiful building, and has such an amazing history. I don’t know if it’ll be easy to get rid of those pesky neighbors. No soliciting.
